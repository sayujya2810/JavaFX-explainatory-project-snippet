# JavaFX-explainatory-project-snippet
This is a small scale project I made to explain the use of JavaFX, scene, scene builder, events, event listeners, use of buttons, textfields and input. And use of random class.
I suggest to use IntelliJ IDE to run this project.
Make sure you have svg and fx file imported or downloaded on your system.
